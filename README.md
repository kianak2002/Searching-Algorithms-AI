# Searching-Algorithms-AI
A*, Bi-BFS, IDS Algorithms for optimal path

## project for Artificial Intelligence course
instructed by [Dr.Behnam Roshanfekr](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=uU25R5IAAAAJ&hl=en)

## Main Purpose
In this project we had a robot, some butters and some plates.
We wanted the robot to find the optimal path to take the butter to the plates by pushing the butters and 
only by getting juxtapose to the butter and pushing it, the butter could be moved.


##Algorithms Used

This project is done with three algorithms {
1.    A* 
2.    Bi-BFS
3.    IDS
}
